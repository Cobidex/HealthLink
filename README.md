# HealthLink

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between the need and provision of healthcare in developing countries, particularly for people who are new to an environment and want to access reliable healthcare, as well as those with specific health needs in search of facilities where they can be treated.

This web-based project aims to connect users with hospitals and other medical facilities based on their location, the services they need, and the name of the facility. By providing a user-friendly interface, users can easily search and locate the medical services they require, even in unfamiliar environments.

With this project, I hope to contribute to improving the accessibility and quality of healthcare for individuals in developing countries, and ultimately, help save lives.

## Features

- Location-based search to easily find hospitals and medical facilities near you.
- Search by hospital or medical facility name to quickly locate the desired service provider.
- Service-based search to help users find facilities that offer specific healthcare services they need.
- User-friendly interface that is easy to navigate, even for people without a medical background.
